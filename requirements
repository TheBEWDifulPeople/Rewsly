- Create a User model, but no views or controllers. 
  - Users can have many submissions (of stories)
- Users should have a name and email address.
  - Validate email addresses are unique 

- Add categories 
  - When a story is entered take a list of categories
- Add a way to see all stories in a given category.

- Add a Source model to track what source news stories come from. 
  - This should be provided when submitting a story via a drop down menu.
  (Doesn't make sense. Let's make this dynamic. You submit a link, and it adds the site to the "sources" table)

- Create a Comments model. Users create comments on stories.
